# VectorLink

VectorLink is not just a vector database, but a vector embedding management suite. It includes utilities to vectorise text, to index vectors, to create field and composite indexing on structured content and to perform [entity resolution / record matching](https://vectorlink.ai/blog/leveraging-llms-and-machine-learning-for-record-matching/).

VectorLink's vector indexing is based on [HNSW](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320) but improves the algorithm with parallel construction and uses circulant graphs to increase recall. Recall in the .90s is possible for millions of vectors.

The suite also contains tools for [LLM Classifier Bootstrapping](https://vectorlink.ai/blog/llm-classifier-bootstrapping/).
